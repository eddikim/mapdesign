# Map Design using MetaTiles

### By Edward Kim

Through this assignment, I utilized QGIS in order to generate four unique tile sets of the city of Seattle through QMetaTiles. The different
tile layers shown in this assignment illustrate how the city can be viewed in more than one way from a geographic perspective. 

## Map 1: Monochrome

- Visualizes the city of Seattle in a monochrome style with a minimum zoom of 1 and maximum zoom of 9

## Map 2: Outdoors
